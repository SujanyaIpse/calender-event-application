# Calendar Event Application

A web-based calendar application built with React that allows users to view events, navigate between months, and create events by selecting dates on the calendar. This project uses `react-big-calendar` and `react-modal` for the calendar view and pop-up modal forms.

## Features

- **Monthly and Weekly Views**: Toggle between month, week, and agenda views for events.
- **Event Creation**: Click on any date to add a new event with a title and description.
- **Date Navigation**: Easily navigate between months using "Back" and "Next" buttons.
- **Customizable Event List**: Displays created events on the calendar.

## Getting Started

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 14 or higher)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (comes with Node.js)

### Installation

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/calendar-app.git
   cd calendar-app/frontend
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

### Running the Application

   ```

2. Open your browser and go to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the app.

### Additional Setup for Modal

If you havenâ€™t already installed `react-modal`, run:

```

## Usage

- **View Calendar**: The main calendar will show the current month by default.

## Components Overview

- **EventForm.js**: Form component that captures event details (title and description) and submits them.

## Customization
